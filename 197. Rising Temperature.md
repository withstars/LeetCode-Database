### 197. Rising Temperature

Given a `Weather` table, write a SQL query to find all dates' Ids with higher temperature compared to its previous (yesterday's) dates.

```
+---------+------------+------------------+
| Id(INT) | Date(DATE) | Temperature(INT) |
+---------+------------+------------------+
|       1 | 2015-01-01 |               10 |
|       2 | 2015-01-02 |               25 |
|       3 | 2015-01-03 |               20 |
|       4 | 2015-01-04 |               30 |
+---------+------------+------------------+

```

For example, return the following Ids for the above Weather table:

```
+----+
| Id |
+----+
|  2 |
|  4 |
+----+
```

## 解法一

```
SELECT Id 
from Weather we
where Temperature > (select Temperature from weather w where w.date = date_sub(we.date,interval 1 day));
```
