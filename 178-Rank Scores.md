### 178. Rank Scores

####分数排行

Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.

```
+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+

```

For example, given the above `Scores` table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):

```
+-------+------+
| Score | Rank |
+-------+------+
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |
+-------+------+
```

####解法一

解题的思路是对于每一个分数，找出表中有多少个大于或等于该分数的分数，不包括其本身，然后按降序排列即可，参见代码如下：

```
select Score ,
(select count(distinct score) from scores where score >= s.score ) AS Rank
from scores as s 
order by score desc;
```
